# DES-Algorithm
Data Encryption Standard(DES) base on Feistal Cipher Data encrypted in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key (effective key) Ciphertext is of 64-bit long Encrypts by series of substitution and transpositions (or permutations).

In binary block ciphers, diffusion can achieved by repeatedly performing some permutation on the data followed by applying a function to that permutation
Confusion can be achieved by the use of a complex substitution algorithm. A simple linear substitution algorithm adds little confusion.

Feistal Cipher provide confusion and diffusion of message.
